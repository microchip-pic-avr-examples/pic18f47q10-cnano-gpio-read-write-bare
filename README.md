# PIC18F47Q10 GPIO Read/Write

## Objective

The PIC18F47Q10 provides multiple PORT modules.

This example describes a basic configuration of an input pin, connected to a button and an output pin, used to turn an LED on and off. To implement this example, one PORT pin is configured as a digital input and another pin is configured as an output.

The input pin is connected to a button and the output pin is connected to an LED. The value of the input pin is read continuously, through polling.
